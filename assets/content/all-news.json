Something good is that he is still with us and even though he has a new face, he still has a lot of ambition to fight against Gladyo!<\/p>","pubdate":"2020-06-03-17-20","start_at":"","end_at":"","total_like":1,"total_dislike":0,"total_comment":1,"all_comments":{"en":[{"DateTime":"05\/06\/2020 10:21:46,459 02:00","NickName":"erikeke","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"lol"}]},"lang_comments":[{"DateTime":"05\/06\/2020 10:21:46,459 02:00","NickName":"erikeke","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"lol"}],"author":"Mj\u00f6lnir","url":"https:\/\/en.idcgames.com\/zula\/news\/the-new-demir-2020-06-03-17-20.html"},{"title":"Closed Beta End","id":3931,"gamename":"Project Xandata","kind":"Normal","body":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.idcgames.com\/storage\/1657\/pxd_thank_you_608.jpg\" style=\"height:608px; width:1080px\" \/><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHello Xandats!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Closed Beta has come to an end.

Players become a Xandat, one of the best soldiers Xandaigdig has to offer. From the combined strength, technology, and weaponry of the Seven Great Nations come a new breed of warriors that fought against other-worldly enemies to bring the world back from the brink of extinction. Players will need to gear up and customize their armor to their personal playstyle as they fight to prove themselves against other Xandats.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Game modes:<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Skirmish - Xandat teams fight in a time-limited skirmish. Each enemy kill will earn points for the team. The first team to reach the appointed Score Value wins. More elaborate take-downs get bonus points. In case of the match reaching the time-limit, the team with the most points win.<br \/>\r\n- Annihilation - Xandat teams face off against each other as they try to wipe the enemy team out in pure weaponized combat. Each team is granted a set number of revives to use in a round. The winner of each round is determined by the last Xandat standing. The overall winner is determined by a race to win 5 rounds during the match.<br \/>\r\n- Corruption - Xandat teams score points by collecting shards dropped by fallen opponents. Enemy points can be denied by collecting dropped shards by team members. Every now and then, an Obelisk will spawn around the map, that when destroyed, will drop multiple shards to collect. The team to reach the goal score or the team with most points by time limit shall win the match.<\/p>","pubdate":"2020-04-01-13-55","start_at":"","end_at":"","total_like":3,"total_dislike":1,"total_comment":4,"all_comments":{"en":[{"DateTime":"05\/04\/2020 12:40:34,719 02:00","NickName":"robu6","Vote":"2","PlayedTime":"","Text":"MMMMMMM"},{"DateTime":"03\/04\/2020 23:55:33,058 02:00","NickName":"fazaa","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"when we can play the game? and hope there is customs game!."}],"el":[{"DateTime":"08\/04\/2020 10:55:20,231 02:00","NickName":"AijaBlina","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"aijablina968inbox.lv "}],"pt":[{"DateTime":"06\/04\/2020 23:23:36,261 02:00","NickName":"DOMAGOJOMAR","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"OKK AL KAK DA UDZEM"}]},"lang_comments":[{"DateTime":"05\/04\/2020 12:40:34,719 02:00","NickName":"robu6","Vote":"2","PlayedTime":"","Text":"MMMMMMM"},{"DateTime":"03\/04\/2020 23:55:33,058 02:00","NickName":"fazaa","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"when we can play the game? and hope there is customs game!."}],"author":"Mj\u00f6lnir","url":"https:\/\/en.idcgames.com\/project-xandata\/news\/idc-games-announces-the-closed-beta-of-project-xandata-2020-04-01-13-55.html"},{"title":"CityBattle | Virtual Earth EU \u2013 Service Closing announcement","id":3805,"gamename":"CityBattle | Virtual Earth EU","kind":"Normal","body":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.idcgames.com\/storage\/1006\/cb-closing.jpg\" style=\"height:608px; width:1080px\" \/><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHello battlers!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe want to inform you that the CityBattle | Virtual Earth EU journey at IDC\/Games is about to finish.

Players become a Xandat, one of the best soldiers Xandaigdig has to offer. From the combined strength, technology, and weaponry of the Seven Great Nations come a new breed of warriors that fought against other-worldly enemies to bring the world back from the brink of extinction. Players will need to gear up and customize their armor to their personal playstyle as they fight to prove themselves against other Xandats.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Game modes:<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Skirmish - Xandat teams fight in a time-limited skirmish. Each enemy kill will earn points for the team. The first team to reach the appointed Score Value wins. More elaborate take-downs get bonus points. In case of the match reaching the time-limit, the team with the most points win.<br \/>\r\n- Annihilation - Xandat teams face off against each other as they try to wipe the enemy team out in pure weaponized combat. Each team is granted a set number of revives to use in a round. The winner of each round is determined by the last Xandat standing. The overall winner is determined by a race to win 5 rounds during the match.<br \/>\r\n- Corruption - Xandat teams score points by collecting shards dropped by fallen opponents. Enemy points can be denied by collecting dropped shards by team members. Every now and then, an Obelisk will spawn around the map, that when destroyed, will drop multiple shards to collect. The team to reach the goal score or the team with most points by time limit shall win the match.<\/p>","pubdate":"2020-04-01-13-55","start_at":"","end_at":"","total_like":3,"total_dislike":1,"total_comment":4,"all_comments":{"en":[{"DateTime":"05\/04\/2020 12:40:34,719 02:00","NickName":"robu6","Vote":"2","PlayedTime":"","Text":"MMMMMMM"},{"DateTime":"03\/04\/2020 23:55:33,058 02:00","NickName":"fazaa","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"when we can play the game? and hope there is customs game!."}],"el":[{"DateTime":"08\/04\/2020 10:55:20,231 02:00","NickName":"AijaBlina","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"aijablina968inbox.lv "}],"pt":[{"DateTime":"06\/04\/2020 23:23:36,261 02:00","NickName":"DOMAGOJOMAR","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"OKK AL KAK DA UDZEM"}]},"lang_comments":[{"DateTime":"05\/04\/2020 12:40:34,719 02:00","NickName":"robu6","Vote":"2","PlayedTime":"","Text":"MMMMMMM"},{"DateTime":"03\/04\/2020 23:55:33,058 02:00","NickName":"fazaa","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"when we can play the game? and hope there is customs game!."}],"author":"Mj\u00f6lnir","url":"https:\/\/en.idcgames.com\/project-xandata\/news\/idc-games-announces-the-closed-beta-of-project-xandata-2020-04-01-13-55.html"},{"title":"Weapons: Blast","id":3779,"gamename":"CityBattle | Virtual Earth EU","kind":"Normal","body":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.idcgames.com\/storage\/847\/guard-blast.jpg\" \/><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Blast is a minigun that has two different fire modes so that it can be used offensively from different ranges.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe minguns are multi-cannon machine guns with a high rate of fire (thousands of bullets per minute), which employ the rotating cannons Gatling system powered by an electric motor fueled from an external power source.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis weapon has two shooting modes:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMode 1 (Left mouse button) -&gt; A moderate rate of fire is used to inflict damage from a wider range.

Before you make a report, however, you need to evaluate correctly if the user is really using an illegal program or if he just plays better than you. Remember that if you are a level 1 player and you fight against a level 40 player, the second one will very likely win. But don&#39;t despair: practice makes perfect!<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u25ba&nbsp;Every report you send us is analysed by our team that spends nearly 5 minutes to check it. We receive 600 reports a day, and every 1200 reports, there is only one that actually reports a user that hacks.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u25ba&nbsp;99,9% of hacking users are detected by either one of the two detection levels Zula has. The first system detects and disconects the user automatically. If the first one doesn&#39;t work, the second system notifies us of the hacker. This procedure allows us to evaluate the PC process, what is influencing the game and what is the user doing. From that moment on, we can establish if the player is hacking or not, and if he is, we can penalize him.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u25ba&nbsp;Our system detects all the illegal programs on a PC. If there&#39;s a hacking program but it&#39;s not been used while the game is open, nothing happens. Programs like cheat engine, extreme injector, hacker process, speed hack, wallhacks, speedhacks, etc are detected inside the game by our protection systems and we are informed so we can take the appropriate measures.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u25ba&nbsp;If a user is blocked from a PC more than twice, he won&#39;t be able to access the game from that PC anymore. Even if you change the IP or the mac address of your PC, you won&#39;t be able to access Zula. If you receive the message: &quot;You can&#39;t access Zula from this PC&quot;, your PC has been blocked. That&#39;ll teach you not to hack!<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u25ba&nbsp;Due to our aggressive policy of bans, we just have 6 or 7 penalizations a day in the last weekd. This means there is no haking inside the game: you must be very sure before you make a report.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u25ba&nbsp;Our goal is to keep the game clean and to create a space where everyone can play with the same conditions and without tools that can jeopardize functioning of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u25ba&nbsp;Remember that every report you send us is been checked, and if it&#39;s false, that takes time from us that could be employed to create event and activities to improve the game. Be sure before you make a report that the player is really doing something wrong.
